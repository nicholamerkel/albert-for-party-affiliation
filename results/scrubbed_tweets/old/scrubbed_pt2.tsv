Productive & substantive discussion with Minnesota state leadership and @3M about the production efforts of protective gear in response to the Coronavirus. We’ll continue to work until state & local officials have the resources they need to respond to the threat of this virus.	1
Heading to Washington to meet with @GovInslee. We are here for the people of Washington and America as we work in the best interest of everyone’s health and safety.	1
VP arrives in Minneapolis for talks at @3M about stepping up manufacture of face mask for healthcare workers dealing with Coronavirus. Press pool told he used flight for calls with Task Force members @SecAzar and @DHS_Wolf.	1
Helpful information from the @TODAYshow this morning.	1
En route to Minnesota to visit @3M, where they are producing critical protection gear for our Nation’s health care providers. We will continue to work with companies like @3M to ensure our local partners have all of the resources they need to care for the American people.	1
"President @realDonaldTrump is leading an aggressive response and preparation effort for coronavirus.
 
Today, Vice President @Mike_Pence will travel to Washington state to meet with Governor Jay Inslee to discuss the ongoing response effort."	1
State & local governments are the backbone of our public health system. They have been essential partners in the ongoing work to contain and mitigate the spread of #COVID19 in the U.S. We announced initial funding to jurisdictions supporting the response: …	1
Today we came to an agreement on a $7.767B Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Package to combat the #Coronavirus. We worked together to craft an aggressive and comprehensive response that provides the resources the experts say they need to combat this crisis.	1
We understand that while the full resources of the federal government are being brought to bear, state health officials and local health officials are on the front lines. We will continue to work tirelessly to give them the tools they need to protect the American people.	1
The American people can be confident that we’re ready thanks to the leadership of President @realDonaldTrump and the dedication of state and local partners and health care professionals at every level.	1
As for funds for companies, it’s to keep entities that employ millions of Americans from folding—it’s to save jobs. Keep this up a little longer and we will go from social distancing to social destruction.	1
Nothing in the Senate has shocked me, until today. Standing in the way of a critically needed rescue package is irresponsible and reckless. Dems say not enough money to states: nearly $200 billion isn’t chump change. Hospitals get at least $75 billion.	1

Deeply saddened by this news. Larry was the audio technician for the @NBCnews team dispatched to cover my 2012 campaign. He was a special part of the Romney Rambler family. Ann and I send our prayers to Larry’s wife, Crystal, his sons, and loved ones. …	1
Americans urgently need cash to meet immediate needs, that’s been my goal from the start. The current bill has promise but it shouldn’t give lower earners smaller checks —that’s directly contrary to my proposal. We need to fix this to ensure lower earners get equal payments.	1
My colleagues and I are working on the next relief package—one that helps American families, workers, and small businesses deal with the financial implications of #COVID19 and shores up our economy. More to come. Stay safe out there—note that we are practicing social distancing!	1
Prayers and hearty well wishes to my friend, Utah Congressman Ben McAdams, who has tested positive for #COVID19. His work from his bed at home on behalf of his district, state and country is laudable, selfless and greatly appreciated.	1
3) If you share your home with younger people, divide your quarantine space by creating a barrier with anything you can find, and keep younger folks who aren’t following a quarantine several feet away from the dividing line.	1
2) Prepare your own meals at home. If you order delivered meals, have them left on the doorstep by specifying “no contact” delivery and make sure to heat them to kill any germs.	1
Working from home may be impossible for you—as it is for me in the Senate. But it’s sure worth a try.	1
1) Practice strict quarantine. Stay in your home, drive alone in your car, or walk by yourselves outdoors where others aren’t around. Avoid restaurants, movie theaters, shopping centers, and airplanes. Work from home until we know more.	1
Everyone, especially seniors and those who are health compromised, should take far more restrictive measures than we are right now. Here’s a checklist from a nurse friend of mine that may be useful for seniors:	1
Re-upping this urgent advice: Seniors & people with compromised health are at greater risk from #COVID19. How much greater? Of the first 803 Italian deaths reported, 98% were 60 or older. Data from other countries also show that older people have a much higher risk of death.	1
Stay well. America needs you.	1

Even if you’re not a senior citizen or in a high-risk group, it’s critical that you limit social contact as much as possible. Younger people are not immune. It’s incumbent on younger people to limit the spread and protect our communities.	1
.@CDCgov’s new guidance advises canceling or postponing any in-person gatherings of >50 people for the next 8 weeks, and advises against gatherings of any size unless using strict precautions. …	1
With kids across the country now staying home from school, it’s especially important for seniors to physically isolate themselves from the rest of the family. Seniors’ high #Covid19 mortality demands high vigilance.	1
All seniors, especially those like me who are over 70, must take every precaution: we are the ones most likely to suffer the most severe complications from COVID-19 that will overwhelm the healthcare system. Please, follow strict social-distancing & even consider self-quarantine.	1
I applaud @Ch_JesusChrist for taking these proactive steps to protect the health of Church members, and their communities. …	1
We’ll get through this. It’ll end. We have two hard months ahead of us. We need to sacrifice some of the trappings of normal life to reduce the scope and severity of what’s ahead. We must protect the vulnerable. We must act collectively in common interest. We must work together.	1
I encourage all Americans to register with the @StateDept’s STEP Program when traveling overseas. Enrolling with the local US Embassy/consulate will help government officials communicate important information on travel to the US and other safety updates.  …	1
A reprehensible threat from Senator Schumer is followed by a laughably illogical prevarication. What ever happened to truth and a simple apology?	1
A remarkable leader who built an even greater GE than he found it. His understated and modest demeanor could not hide the brilliance and passion that propelled his career. Never a spectator, always a participant. Ann and I will miss our friendship that spanned three decades. …	1
Remarkable and impressive that the invasion of the highly contagious COVID-19 into the US has been delayed. Thanks to the professionals fighting it, caring for the sick, and racing to find treatments and vaccines. A time for appreciation, not politics.	1
Some things never change. Happy Valentine’s Day, sweetheart.	1
Rush Limbaugh is a fighter. In this battle with lung cancer, he will face this fight with the same tenacity in which he has delivered his show for the past three decades. Keeping Rush and his family in my prayers.	1
It meant taking no shortcuts and always striving to be the absolute best version of oneself. Praying for his wife, daughters, and loved ones in this difficult time.	1
Heartbreaking news about Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna, and all others aboard, all gone from this world far too soon. Kobe’s “mamba mentality,” which led to so many accolades on the court, was about much more than basketball.	1

Merry Christmas from our family to yours!	1
Our office Christmas tree was the envy of the Senate—12 feet tall! We of course decorated the tree with Utah ornaments…and some non-traditional items as well. Fun fact: Twinkies also make excellent ornaments!	1
China demands a loyalty oath from the press, imprisons minorities, uses facial recognition to monitor and repress dissenters, censors the internet and media, and then boasts of glorious unity. How dear American freedom, so hard won. …	1
Heartfelt sorrow with the death of Pete Frates, the young baseball star stricken with ALS who inspired the #IceBucketChallenge that raised millions for critical research. A legacy of courage, grace and nobility even as life dealt him tragedy.	1
Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours!	1
I love apple pie. I like pumpkin pie. But I really love pecan pie.	1
To the men and women who are in our Armed Services, whether here at home or somewhere across the world: Thank you. We appreciate the sacrifices you make for our freedom, for our prosperity, and for our future. From my family to yours: Happy Thanksgiving!	1
While I hope the Administration will act without further delay on its prior proposal to ban flavors that appeal to kids, I will also continue to push for my legislation that bans flavors, ensures that vaping cartridges are tamper-proof, and bans e-cigarettes from schools.	1
Appreciated @POTUS's efforts to bring together stakeholders & experts to discuss proposals to solve the youth vaping epidemic. Everyone agrees this is a serious problem, but it’s clear there are differing views about the best way to develop responsible guidelines to protect kids. …	1
We owe a debt of gratitude to each of our veterans for their service and sacrifice on behalf of our great country. To each of the men and women who’ve defended our freedoms and our very lives, with a great sense of appreciation, thank you for helping America remain free and safe.	1
Prof. Warren’s Medicare for All fails the test: Countries with socialized medicine make their numbers work through limits on care, cost sharing, and higher middle class taxes. Pretending otherwise is inauthentic and disingenuous.	1
Ann and I are heartbroken for the victims of the horrific attacks in Mexico. Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence.	1
While Warren and Sanders push Medicare for All, they apparently haven’t noticed that Medicare for Some is about to go bankrupt. Instead of fairy tale proposals, we should take bipartisan steps toward making sure current programs are around for the long-haul.	1
Great costumes! Thomas, #OutOfTheWill! …	1

It’s unthinkable that Turkey would not suffer consequences for malevolent behavior which was contrary to the interests of the United States and our friends.	1
Pleased to see @UUtah selected by the Commission on Presidential Debates to host the 2020 VP Debate. The importance of service and civility are two core values in the hearts of Utahns, and I can’t think of a better state to host this debate. Appreciate the work of @UtahDebateCom. …	1
Reports indicate Turkey is predictably attacking the Kurdish allies we abandoned. It’s a tragic loss of life among friends shamefully betrayed. We can only hope the President’s decision does not lead to even greater loss of life and a resurgence of ISIS.	1
Barring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests. My statement with @ChrisMurphyCT→  …	1
This President’s decision to abandon our Kurdish allies in Northern Syria is ultimately a victory for Assad, Russia, Iran, and ISIS. The Administration must immediately reconsider withdrawing the few remaining U.S. troops who are playing a vital peacekeeping role.	1
Enjoyed the pumpkin patch with my sweetheart and the two little pumpkins we brought with us!	1
By all appearances, the President’s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.	1
When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.	1
Rush Limbaugh claims Mitt Romney told Nancy Pelosi the Senate would convict Trump. It isn’t true.   #utpol	1
If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out.	1
Congratulations to my friend Robert O’Brien, who the President has appointed to serve as National Security Advisor. As the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, he has doggedly pursued the release of American hostages abroad. He is a man of the highest integrity.	1
Direct engagement by US military in response to Iran’s attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake. The US has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If SA responds against Iran attacks, the US should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.	1
At the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, eight athletes carried in the American flag that was flying above the World Trade Center on 9/11. There was not a dry eye in that stadium. That flag was a symbol of all the innocent lives we lost that day. May we #NeverForget.	1
On the anniversary of #September11th, we honor all of those who lost their lives—including the first responders who rushed into harm’s way. We also salute the brave men and women who have served in defense of our great nation since that day. #NeverForget	1
.@US_FDA should consider recalling e-cigarettes as it continues to investigate recent deaths and illnesses related to vaping. I’m increasingly concerned that a generation of young people has been deceived into thinking e-cigarettes are safe.	1
Johnny Isakson has cast a bright beam in our nation’s Capitol. A man of rare integrity, unwavering honesty & profound character, his work has helped shape American greatness. His decision to retire from the Senate will dim the light of goodness he’s shed on it for so many years.	1
.@CindyMcCain and the McCain family have created a new way to honor John’s legacy by encouraging #ActsofCivility. John left this country and this world better off, and this is a wonderful way to keep his spirit and character alive.	1
Today marks one year since the passing of John McCain. Courageous, honorable, driven by a duty to family, country & God, John exemplified the values we as Americans hold so dear. I'm blessed to have called him a friend. May we continue to be inspired by his heroism and character.	1
Iran’s vicious threats to an American citizen and to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies are further examples of its treachery, its untrustworthiness and its malign intent. Those in businesses or governments who look away from this reality make a dangerous error.	1

CBO confirmed our deficit is on a dangerous trajectory. But right now, neither party seems to be focused on our debt. Inaction is beyond irresponsible. In the coming weeks, I’ll be introducing a bill to force Congress to address the drivers of our spending to avoid a debt crisis. …	1
In an era of ballooning deficits; social, racial, and economic divisions; and isolationist tendencies, socialism isn’t the solution. Conservatives must promote a governing vision that reaffirms our core principles. …	1

The worth of freedom is most clear when it is won, or when it is lost; the passion and courage of the people of Hong Kong remind us of freedom’s precious strain. Their fight is our fight. Pray they succeed.	1
Protests in Hong Kong are further exposing China’s relentless campaign of repression, censorship, and the imprisonment of millions. I support the people of Hong Kong in their quest for freedom and autonomy. The Chinese Communist Party and the military should stay in Beijing.	1
The nation has witnessed senseless loss of life from recent mass shootings in El Paso, Dayton, and Gilroy. My statement:	1
Another heartbreaking and senseless attack. Madness, this killing of God’s children. We mourn for the victims in Dayton and for the many who knew and loved them.	1
Our hearts go out to the victims, families, and loved ones of the tragic shooting in El Paso. From what dark and repugnant corner of the mind comes such senseless and vile brutality?	1
About to vote on the budget and debt limit deal, which I’m opposing because it adds another $2 trillion to the debt. We need a new track to repair our fiscal foundation and save our children & grandchildren from a future debt crisis.	1
Nice try, but socialism isn’t the answer. If it was, maybe Bernie would have something to show for his 3 decades in Congress. #AllHatNoCattle …	1
Asked why @BernieSanders is so angry, the answer is simple: 28 years in Congress and never able to pass even a scintilla of his socialist agenda. All hat, no cattle.	1
The chants at last night’s rally were offensive, and I’m glad the President has disavowed them.	1
My favorite meat is hot dog  Happy #NationalHotDogDay!	1
People can disagree over politics and policy, but telling American citizens to go back to where they came from is over the line.	1
The president’s comments were destructive, demeaning, and disunifying. The President of the United States has a unique and noble calling to unite the American people – of all different races, colors, and national origins. In that respect, the president failed badly.	1
His selfless leadership and lifelong policy work were critical to the tax and regulatory reform that have helped propel the economy. A man like Paul Ryan does not often come along.	1
The fault for our 2012 loss is mine alone; @SpeakerRyan was a tireless campaigner, fundraiser, and conservative champion. As the sole person who could unite the House, he acquiesced to be Speaker as a service to the country.	1
Congratulations @USWNT on your hard-fought victory! Back-to-back World Champions. Simply amazing. #OneNationOneTeam …	1
The words of the Declaration of Independence outlined a revolutionary principle: Government is not there for the king or the feudal lord. The government is there for the people. Today, we celebrate the ideals upon which our country was founded. Happy #IndependenceDay 	1
The President’s praise for MBS, the man who US intel says ordered or authorized the heinous murder of a WaPo columnist & Saudi dissident, sends the wrong message to the world. It’s past time for Congress & the administration to impose sanctions for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.	1

Very pleased that Russia has released the two Church volunteers and that they are now returning home to their families. …	1
I can’t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God.	1
Deeply saddened by the terrorist attacks at the mosques in New Zealand—pure evil. We must reject hatred, in our own country and across the globe. Praying for the 49 innocent people who lost their lives and their families, as well as those who were injured.	1
The President made the right decision to ground the 737 MAX. This is a commonsense step until the causes of the recent crashes have been investigated and pilots’ concerns have been addressed to ensure safety. …	1
Out of an abundance of caution for the flying public, the @FAANews should ground the 737 MAX 8 until we investigate the causes of recent crashes and ensure the plane’s airworthiness.	1
My team surprised me with a cake made out of my favorite snack—twinkies! Looking forward to all this year has in store.	1

Tonight, Senate Democrats blocked a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It’s unconscionable & inhumane that some in our country, especially members of Congress, are unwilling to take a stand and support the lives of newborns who survive an abortion attempt.	1
The beauty of our state is unmatched—looking out over Eagle Canyon.	1
I am concerned that the Administration has yet to comply with the law, nor has it sufficiently explained why. As has been requested by members of both parties, I urge the Administration to rectify this urgent situation and brief Congress on its progress as soon as possible.	1
The question that Congress wants answered is whether any senior Saudi officials, including members of the Saudi royal family, were responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. By law, the President is required to report to Congress on these findings & imposition of sanctions.	1

Putin today blames US politics for icy relations. Get real: It was Russia invading sovereign nations, propping up dictators, hacking elections, abusing human rights, and cheating at the Olympics.	1
By sanctioning Russia, Olympic officials place honor and integrity above money and politics. Russia under Putin is shown, once again, to place winning above the rule of law, above honesty, and above the interests of its own athletes.	1

"What you are watching in Senate right now is just a bunch of posturing to protect their leverage in negotiations. 

Given all the economic suffering people are facing I simply can’t imagine we end today without passing a deal. The alternative is too horrific to even contemplate."	1
"Millions of additional Americans will lose their job over the next few days. 

For us in the Senate today MUST BE a day of action."	1

"People are losing their jobs & their small business. 

And all we hear about is how much some huge company is going to get or about fights over the proper name for the virus. 

Can we please focus on getting cash to these small businesses so they pay their workers again."	1
"Virtually every American was either laid off or has family members & friends who have. 

I know AN ENTIRE IMMEDIATE FAMILY (husband,wife,two adult children & their 2 spouses) all laid off in last 72 hours. 

But some people want to argue over what name we should use for the virus"	1
"Small/mid size business owners are also employees themselves. The trauma this is inflicting on them,their employees & our country is severe. 

We don’t have the luxury of days to kick around ideas or try to one-up each other. We need to reach agreement & act now. 5/5"	1
Small/mid size employers don’t have billion $ lines of credit to draw down on. They don’t have a few weeks before they run out of operating cash. They are (often tearfully) laying off workers all over the country,by the minute because they have no choice. 4/5	1
Goal is to quicklyprovide employers enough cash to keep workers on payroll & bring back laid off workers onto payroll,for the next 5 to 6 weeks. Keeping your paycheck,even if the govt isn’t allowing you to work is far better use than forcing people to get unemployment checks. 3/5	1
"Our plan uses any preferred 7(a) lender or any bank,credit union or lender approved by @USTreasury 
to get  to small/mid size employers in a matter of days (not weeks). If they use it to keep their workers on payroll they DO NOT have to pay it back. 2/5"	1
"The shiny object in the press is plans to give $ to big name corporations & govt checks to people. 

But the most important & urgent need to is keep the small/mid-size employers most Americans work for from going under. 

The plan is detailed on 5 part threat 1/5"	1
"Here we go again with the “my friend whose dad works in the government” rumors. 

I don’t know if these are from #Putin trolls or the guys sitting around bored in their moms basement, but either way NO IT IS NOT TRUE"	1
"Most Americans don’t work for a Fortune 1000 corporation. They work for the small or mid-size business that are shutting down not 30 days from now,  but by the hour. 

If we don’t act fast on our plan to get them cash QUICKLY the number of people out of work will be staggering."	1

I will be [here] until we get this done because millions upon millions of families & their immediate & long-term future are being determined by what we do or fail to do.	1
"Thanks for the support. 

And for those in media covering this PLEASE  make clear in your stories that these are NOT traditional “small business loans”. 

These are FORGIVABLE LOANS,processed by private lenders,that if you use to pay workers are FORGIVEN & don’t turn into debt. …"	1
Strong support for key elements of our proposal. We have to move fast and act fast to save jobs.	1
"Just had our first meeting with our democratic colleagues on our plan to save small businesses & keep people employed through this crisis. I believe everyone recognizes the urgency of & that we will get this done quickly. 

People are being laid off by the minute."	1
"We only have 3 months of information on  #Covid_19

We have created the perception that younger people have nothing to worry about. 

We now need to stop saying that.

In the U.S. 38% of those hospitalized are under 35.

In France half of those in the ICU are under 65."	1
Our goal is that as many small businesses as possible will be able to go to their existing bank,if they agree to participate,and get the cash they need to make payroll & business rent/lease & if they use it for that purpose not have to pay it back.	1
"Worked all night trying to finalize so bear with us on all details until finalized

But goal is straightforward:

Get cash to small business are fast & easy as possible so they don’t have to lay people off & if they use it for that purpose doesn’t have to be paid back  7/7"	1
5. This will NOT exclude any industry. It WILL apply to s corp, C Corp, non-profits, partnerships, sole practitioners, etc. who meet the expanded criteria for small business. Again the goal is to be inclusive not exclusive. 6/7	1
4. The criteria for what qualifies as a small business is still being worked out. BUT,lots of agreement that it needs to be more inclusive than current definition. The goal is to reach the largest % of Americans workers as possible. And I feel confident we can achieve this. 5/7	1
3. Existing 7(a) lenders ready to go right away. But everyone agrees that the list lenders involved needs to be expanded rapidly & we create a process to do that. The ideal outcome is for small businesses to be able to do all this with their own bank if they want. 4/7	1
2. This is NOT some traditional SBA direct loan or program. We are using many of the guidelines & infrastructure of the 7(a) program but they will NOT be calling a government agency for this help. It will be handled by a bank,credit union or other lender in their community. 3/7	1
1. What we are discussing are FORGIVEABLE Loans. Whatever they take out from this assistance program & use for payroll & business and rent/lease/mortgage will NOT have to be repaid. Limit on what they get will be some multiple of their payroll/expenses before the crisis hit. 2/7	1
"Many employers deciding RIGHT NOW whether to do layoffs &/or close down. 

So it is REALLY important we clearly communicate what is being worked on to help small business. 

If you are a member of the media reporting on impact of #Covid_19 on small biz PLEASE read this thread 1/7"	1

"Key details on the Business Interruption Loans for small biz:

They would NOT have to be paid back up to the amount used for paying workers & other operating expenses

You would apply to & receive funds via banks,including community banks & credit unions, not a govt agency"	1
"The basic concept of getting cash into the hands of small businesses so they don’t have to layoff workers has bipartisan support

We are building on our talks last week with House leaders & Senator Cardin so we can move as fast as possible on this. We have days,not weeks to act."	1
We need to get money to small business in America swiftly so they don’t have to lay off millions of workers due to government not allowing them to operate.	1
"Acceptance that what we are facing is unprecedented & extraordinary is widespread in the Senate

But it is still NOT universal

Our small business IMPACT Act would guarantee small business loans at 90 percent. The Senate should include it in the House bill. 4/4	1
The way to fix this is to turn future tax credit value into current cash flow. That requires loans. My expansion of SBA loan guarantees would give banks the certainty they need to make credit available to small businesses 3/4	1
The House bill creates tax credits to offset the cost of providing paid leave. What businesses need, though, is cash flow today. A tax credit that comes later means nothing to a small business that needs to make payroll tonight 2/4i	1

Families and businesses need help now to survive the China virus pandemic. But @SpeakerPelosi walked away from negotiations to write her own bill, full of absurd provisions completely unrelated to the crisis at hand. Here’s what Speaker Pelosi is demanding while Americans suffer:	1
"We will not forget this. More businesses are closing tomorrow while you peddle this lie. You literally stopped a good bill because it *didn’t have enough red tape*. You hate American businesses so much that you would sacrifice our economy out of pure contempt.
